;;; Commentary:

;; Umbrella entry point that pulls in all three agent-shell-hq
;; modules (toggle, peek, label) so the package can be loaded and
;; configured as a single unit, e.g. via `use-package'.

;;; Code:

(require 'agent-shell-hq-toggle)
(require 'agent-shell-hq-peek)
(require 'agent-shell-hq-label)

(provide 'agent-shell-hq)
;;; agent-shell-hq.el ends here
